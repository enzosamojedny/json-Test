This is a project under development.

You see, I love financial stuff.
That's why this project started as just practice, and it somehow grew up to be a full CRUD console app (bank simulator).
This was meant to be a small project, just for fun, but now that things are under motion, the sky's the limit. Or not.

FAQs
Why json as database?
-Because i worked with SQL for months and i wanted to try something fun and new! (I try to simulate SQL relationships with OOP anyway).

What will you add next?
-Well, what's the fun of just simulating bank transfers? I intend to add some ASCII art and the ability to navigate using arrows,
 and maybe even create receipts with pdf, why not? I'll try to add stuff while I go.
